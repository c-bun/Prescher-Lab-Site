I"ç<p>We are also involved in the <a href="https://www.chem.uci.edu/~jsnowick/outreach/UCI_Outreach/index.html">UCI Chemistry Outreach Program</a>, which focuses on sparking interests in chemistry in K-12 students. During these visits, volunteers from various labs perform general chemistry demonstrations for the students, such as elephantâ€™s toothpaste and the flame test. Each year the program reaches out to more than 3,000 students in over two dozen schools across Orange County.</p>

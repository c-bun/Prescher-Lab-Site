I"Ù<p>There is no denying that science outreach is important. In addition to improving science communication and public understanding, outreach activities give us a chance to get people from various backgrounds (including football players!) excited about chemistry. Itâ€™s also a lot of fun and extremely rewarding! We are actively involved in several outreach programs around campus, with the goal of engaging young minds and inspiring the next generation of scientists.</p>

I"2<p>Target recognition and cell-cell contacts are crucial to numerous physiological processes, including neurotransmission, immune function and cell migration, yet there are few practical methods to globally assay such interactions in whole organisms.  We are developing general, readily accessible methods to study cellular interactions in vivo that blend the sensitivity and noninvasive qualities of optical imaging with the spatial resolution and exquisite detail of histology.  These probes are designed to produce light only when cells are in close proximity or direct contact, enabling researchers to identify cell interactions on a macroscopic scale, without the need to expose or collect tissue.  We are using the contact-dependent tools to monitor tumor metastases, gut microbiota, and tissue transplants.</p>

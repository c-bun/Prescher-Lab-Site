We are developing novel imaging tools to visualize immune surveillance mechanisms and host-microbe interactions. These processes involve multiple cell types and communication networksâ€”features that have been historically difficult to image en masse. To capture such multicellular interactions, we are crafting designer bioluminescent probes. Our approach involves re-engineering luciferase enzymes, generating panels of mutants that accept chemically distinct luciferin analogs.  When the mutants and analogs are mixed together, light is produced only when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interact.  This strategy is providing a collection of bioluminescent probes suitable for visualizing multiple cell populations in vivo, analogous to the palette of fluorescent proteins available for multi-component labeling in vitro.

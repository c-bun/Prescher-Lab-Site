There is a need for an expanded set of chemical tools for imaging bioactive metabolites.  Secreted peptides and small molecules underlie diverse forms of cellular communication, but these biomolecules cannot be easily monitored with genetic tags. We are identifying biocompatible (bioorthogonal) chemical reactions that can be used to visualize cellular metabolites in vivo.  Our focus is on identifying small, stable reagents that are broadly applicable to biomolecule visualization and can be used concurrently in live cells.  To date, we have developed bioorthogonal tools to profile the interplay between host cells and pathogens.  We are also applying the chemical probes to track microbial peptides and lectins.

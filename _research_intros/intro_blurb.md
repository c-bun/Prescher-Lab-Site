Our research program bridges several disciplines and blends a variety of chemical and biological techniques. In one area, we are crafting bioluminescent probes for multi-cellular imaging in whole organisms. In a second area, we are generating chemical reactions to tag bioactive small molecules involved in cellular communication. Our third research goal involves developing tools that selectively illuminate cell-cell contacts. Collectively, these tools are enabling cellular interactions to be examined on a global scale and in whole organisms.

- Robby's perspective piece on bioorthogonal phosphines is now out in print. Check it out in the [Israel Journal of Chemistry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijch.202200070).
- Congrats to Kat! She was selected for a medical writing internship at Gilead.

#### November 2022
- Our paper on multiplexed bioluminescence imaging with a substrate unmixing platform is now published in [Cell Chemical Biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945622003580). Congrats to lab alumni Carly, Zi, Anastasia, and Colin!
- Our collaborative paper on longitudinal monitoring of individual infection progression in Drosophila melanogaster with the Wunderlich lab can now be viewed in [iScience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222016509#!). Congrats to lab alumna Anna!
- Congrats to Lila and our collaborators in the Lupták and Steward labs! Their symposium proposal on dynamic RNA imaging was accepted for presentation at this spring's upcoming International Conference on Learning and Memory.

#### October 2022

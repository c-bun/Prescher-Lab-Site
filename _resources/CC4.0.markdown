"Cross Compare" 4.0 is a python script that we use to find orthogonal compound/enzyme pairs for our bioluminescent imaging projects. It takes as input a .csv file with mutant and compound light emission values and outputs a .csv file with potential pairings ranked by orthogonality. The download file contains some sample input and output to demonstrate the required formatting for the .csv files.

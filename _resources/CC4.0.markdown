"Cross Compare" is a python script that we use to find orthogonal compound/enzyme pairs for our bioluminescent imaging projects. It takes as input a .csv file with mutant and compound light emission values and outputs a .csv file with potential pairings ranked by orthogonality. The download file contains some sample input and output to demonstrate the required formatting for the .csv files. See [this link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00394) for our publication on this work.

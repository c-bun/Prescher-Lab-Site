We are also involved in the [UCI Chemistry Outreach Program](https://www.chem.uci.edu/~jsnowick/outreach/UCI_Outreach/index.html), which focuses on sparking interests in chemistry in K-12 students. During these visits, volunteers from various labs perform general chemistry demonstrations for the students, such as elephant's toothpaste and the flame test. Each year the program reaches out to more than 3,000 students in over two dozen schools across Orange County.
